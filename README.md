## Cipherbot
A discord bot to practice aristocrats for the Science Olympiad Codebusters event.

# Usage
This bot supports slash commands. Use **/aristocrat** to get an aristocrat, **/help** to get information regarding bot usage, **/hint** to get the first letter, and **/answer** to get the plaintext of the cipher. 
Note: In aristocrats, some letters do map to each other, so beware of that issue.

# Server
The support server and the only place the bot can be used (unless you run it locally) can be joined with this link: https://discord.gg/Cu5sYMg4Uz. 

# Running Locally
1. Create a bot application on Discord's developer portal.
2. Make a copy of cipherbot.py.
3. Create an environment folder called ".env" with the token, which can be found on your Discord's developer portal.
4. Replace "ID_HERE" in the cipherbot.py file with the server ID of the server that you want the bot to be in.
5. You're good to go!
