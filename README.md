# Cipherbot
A discord bot to practice aristocrats for the Science Olympiad Codebusters event.

## Usage
This bot supports slash commands. Use **/aristocrat** to get an aristocrat, **/help** to get information regarding bot usage, **/hint** to get the first letter, and **/answer** to get the plaintext of the cipher. 

**NOTE**: In aristocrats, some letters do map to each other, so beware of that issue.

## Server
The support server and the only place the bot can be used (unless you run it locally) can be joined with this link: https://discord.gg/Cu5sYMg4Uz. 

## Running Locally
1. Create a bot application on Discord's developer portal.
2. Open your shell and git clone this repository or create a python file and copy the code in cipherbot.py to that file. 
3. Create an environment folder called ".env" in the same folder as the python file or repository and paste the token in the file as follows: DISCORD_TOKEN = "TOKEN". Your token can be found on your Discord's developer portal.
5. Go through the python file and replace "ID_HERE" in the cipherbot.py file with the server ID of the server that you want the bot to be in.
6. Add the bot to your server.
7. Run the python file, and the bot is ready to be used.
